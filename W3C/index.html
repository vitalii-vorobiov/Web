            <article>
                <h4>1.1. Background</h4>
                <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                <p>HTML is the World Wide Web’s core markup language. Originally, HTML was primarily designed as a language for semantically describing scientific documents. Its general design, however, has enabled it to be adapted, over the subsequent years, to describe a number of other types of documents and even applications.</p>

                <h4>1.2. Audience</h4>
                <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                <p>This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features defined in this specification, implementors of tools that operate on pages that use the features defined in this specification, and individuals wishing to establish the correctness of documents or implementations with respect to the requirements of this specification.</p>
                <p>This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already have at least a passing familiarity with Web technologies, as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity for completeness. More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can provide a gentler introduction to the topic.</p>
                <p>In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a complete understanding of some of the more technical parts of this specification. An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML, Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will also be helpful in places but is not essential.</p>
            </article>

                <h4>1.3. Scope</h4>
                <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                <p>This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup language and associated semantic-level scripting APIs for authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static documents to dynamic applications.</p>
                <p>The scope of this specification does not include providing mechanisms for media-specific customization of presentation (although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included at the end of this specification, and several mechanisms for hooking into CSS are provided as part of the language).</p>
                <p>The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating system. In particular, hardware configuration software, image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out of scope. In terms of applications, this specification is targeted specifically at applications that would be expected to be used by users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate locations, with low CPU requirements. Examples of such applications include online purchasing systems, searching systems, games (especially multiplayer online games), public telephone books or address books, communications software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion software), document editing software, etc.</p>

                <h4>1.4. History</h4>
                <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                <p>For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a number of extensions, primarily hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.</p>
                <p>With the creation of the W3C, HTML’s development changed venue again. A first abortive attempt at extending HTML in 1995 known as HTML 3.0 then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as HTML 3.2, which was completed in 1997. HTML 4.01 quickly followed later that same year.</p>
                <p>The following year, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on an XML-based equivalent, called XHTML. This effort started with a reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML, known as XHTML 1.0, which added no new features except the new serialization, and which was completed in 2000. After XHTML 1.0, the W3C’s focus turned to making it easier for other working groups to extend XHTML, under the banner of XHTML Modularization. In parallel with this, the W3C also worked on a new language that was not compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages, calling it XHTML 2.0.</p>
                <p>Around the time that HTML’s evolution was stopped in 1998, parts of the API for HTML developed by browser vendors were specified and published under the name DOM Level 1 (in 1998) and DOM Level 2 Core and DOM Level 2 HTML (starting in 2000 and culminating in 2003). These efforts then petered out, with some DOM Level 3 specifications published in 2004 but the working group being closed before all the Level 3 drafts were completed.</p>
                <p>In 2003, the publication of XForms, a technology which was positioned as the next generation of Web forms, sparked a renewed interest in evolving HTML itself, rather than finding replacements for it. This interest was borne from the realization that XML’s deployment as a Web technology was limited to entirely new technologies (like RSS and later Atom), rather than as a replacement for existing deployed technologies (like HTML).</p>
                <p>A proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML 4.01’s forms to provide many of the features that XForms 1.0 introduced, without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines that were incompatible with existing HTML Web pages, was the first result of this renewed interest. At this early stage, while the draft was already publicly available, and input was already being solicited from all sources, the specification was only under Opera Software’s copyright.</p>
                <p>The idea that HTML’s evolution should be reopened was tested at a W3C workshop in 2004, where some of the principles that underlie the HTML work (described below), as well as the aforementioned early draft proposal covering just forms-related features, were presented to the W3C jointly by Mozilla and Opera. The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal conflicted with the previously chosen direction for the Web’s evolution; the W3C staff and membership voted to continue developing XML-based replacements instead.</p>
                <p>Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced their intent to continue working on the effort under the umbrella of a new venue called the WHATWG. A public mailing list was created, and the draft was moved to the WHATWG site. The copyright was subsequently amended to be jointly owned by all three vendors, and to allow reuse of the specification.</p>
                <p>The WHATWG was based on several core principles, in particular that technologies need to be backwards compatible, that specifications and implementations need to match even if this means changing the specification rather than the implementations, and that specifications need to be detailed enough that implementations can achieve complete interoperability without reverse-engineering each other.</p>
                <p>The latter requirement in particular required that the scope of the HTML specification include what had previously been specified in three separate documents: HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.1, and DOM Level 2 HTML. It also meant including significantly more detail than had previously been considered the norm.</p>
                <p>In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML 5.0 after all, and in 2007 formed a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML specification. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specification under the W3C copyright, while keeping a version with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG site.</p>
                <p>For a number of years, both groups then worked together under the same editor: Ian Hickson. In 2011, the groups came to the conclusion that they had different goals: the W3C wanted to draw a line in the sand for features for a HTML 5.0 Recommendation, while the WHATWG wanted to continue working on a Living Standard for HTML, continuously maintaining the specification and adding new features. In mid 2012, a new editing team was introduced at the W3C to take care of creating a HTML 5.0 Recommendation and prepare a Working Draft for the next HTML version.</p>
                <p>
                    Since then, the W3C Web Platform WG has been cherry picking patches from the WHATWG that resolved bugs registered on the W3C HTML specification or more accurately represented implemented reality in user agents. At time of publication of this document, patches from the
                    <a href="">WHATWG HTML specification</a>
                    have been merged until January 12, 2016. The W3C HTML editors have also added patches that resulted from discussions and decisions made by the W3C Web Platform WG as well a bug fixes from bugs not shared by the WHATWG.</p>
                <p>A separate document is published to document the differences between the HTML specified in this document and the language described in the HTML 4.01 specification.

                <h4>1.5. Design notes</h4>
                <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                <p>It must be admitted that many aspects of HTML appear at first glance to be nonsensical and inconsistent.</p>
                <p>HTML, its supporting DOM APIs, as well as many of its supporting technologies, have been developed over a period of several decades by a wide array of people with different priorities who, in many cases, did not know of each other’s existence.</p>
                <p>Features have thus arisen from many sources, and have not always been designed in especially consistent ways. Furthermore, because of the unique characteristics of the Web, implementation bugs have often become de-facto, and now de-jure, standards, as content is often unintentionally written in ways that rely on them before they can be fixed.</p>
                <p>Despite all this, efforts have been made to adhere to certain design goals. These are described in the next few subsections.</p>

                <h5>1.5.1. Serializability of script execution</h5>
                <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                <p>
                    To avoid exposing Web authors to the complexities of multithreading, the HTML and DOM APIs are designed such that no script can ever detect the simultaneous execution of other scripts. Even with
                    <a href="">workers</a>
                    , the intent is that the behavior of implementations can be thought of as completely serializing the execution of all scripts in all
                    <a href="">browsing contexts.</a>
                </p>

                <h5>1.5.2. Compliance with other specifications</h5>
                <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                <p>This specification interacts with and relies on a wide variety of other specifications. In certain circumstances, unfortunately, conflicting needs have led to this specification violating the requirements of these other specifications. Whenever this has occurred, the transgressions have each been noted as a "<b>willful violation</b>", and the reason for the violation has been noted.</p>

                <h5>1.5.3. Extensibility</h5>
                <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                <p>HTML has a wide array of extensibility mechanisms that can be used for adding semantics in a safe manner:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Authors can use the
                            <a href="">class</a>
                            attribute to extend elements, effectively creating their own elements, while using the most applicable existing "real" HTML element, so that browsers and other tools that don’t know of the extension can still support it somewhat well. This is the tack used by microformats, for example.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Authors can include data for inline client-side scripts or server-side site-wide scripts to process using the
                            <a href="">data-*=""</a>
                            attributes. These are guaranteed to never be touched by browsers, and allow scripts to include data on HTML elements that scripts can then look for and process.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Authors can use the
                            <a href="">&lt;meta name="" content=""&gt;</a>
                            mechanism to include page-wide metadata by registering
                            <a href="">extensions to the predefined set of metadata names</a>
                            .
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Authors can use the
                            <a href="">rel=""</a>
                            mechanism to annotate links with specific meanings by registering
                            <a href="">extensions to the predefined set of link types</a>
                            . This is also used by microformats.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Authors can embed raw data using the
                            <a href="">&lt;script type=""&gt;</a>
                            mechanism with a custom type, for further handling by inline or server-side scripts.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Authors can extend APIs using the JavaScript prototyping mechanism. This is widely used by script libraries, for instance.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                <h4>1.6. HTML vs XML Syntax</h4>
                <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                <p>This specification defines an abstract language for describing documents and applications, and some APIs for interacting with in-memory representations of resources that use this language.</p>
                <p>The in-memory representation is known as "DOM HTML", or "the DOM" for short.</p>
                <p>There are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit resources that use this abstract language, two of which are defined in this specification.</p>
                <p>
                    The first such concrete syntax is the HTML syntax. This is the format suggested for most authors. It is compatible with most legacy Web browsers. If a document is transmitted with the
                    <a href="">text/html</a>
                    <a href="">MIME type</a>
                    , then it will be processed as an HTML document by Web browsers. This specification defines the latest version of the HTML syntax, known simply as "HTML".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second concrete syntax is the XHTML syntax, which is an application of XML. When a document is transmitted with an
                    <a href="">XML MIME type</a>
                    , such as
                    <a href="">application/xhtml+xml</a>, then it is treated as an XML document by Web browsers, to be parsed by an XML processor. Authors are reminded that the processing for XML and HTML differs; in particular, even minor syntax errors will prevent a document labeled as XML from being rendered fully, whereas they would be ignored in the HTML syntax. This specification defines the latest version of the XHTML syntax, known simply as "XHTML".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The DOM, the HTML syntax, and the XHTML syntax cannot all represent the same content. For example, namespaces cannot be represented using the HTML syntax, but they are supported in the DOM and in the XHTML syntax. Similarly, documents that use the
                    <a href="">&lt;noscript&gt;</a>
                    feature can be represented using the HTML syntax, but cannot be represented with the DOM or in the XHTML syntax. Comments that contain the string "-->" can only be represented in the DOM, not in the HTML and XHTML syntaxes.

                <h4>1.7. Structure of this specification</h4>
                <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
                <p>This specification is divided into the following major sections:</p>

                <nav>
                    <!--TODO: Add navigation with paragraphs-->
                </nav>

                <p>
                    There are also some appendices, listing
                    <a href="">§11 Obsolete features</a>
                    and
                    <a href="">§12 IANA considerations</a>
                    , and several indices.

            <article>
                <h5>1.7.1. How to read this specification</h5>
                <p>This specification should be read like all other specifications. First, it should be read cover-to-cover, multiple times. Then, it should be read backwards at least once. Then it should be read by picking random sections from the contents list and following all the cross-references.</p>
                <p>As described in the conformance requirements section below, this specification describes conformance criteria for a variety of conformance classes. In particular, there are conformance requirements that apply to <em>producers</em>, for example authors and the documents they create, and there are conformance requirements that apply to <em>consumers</em>, for example Web browsers. They can be distinguished by what they are requiring: a requirement on a producer states what is allowed, while a requirement on a consumer states how software is to act.</p>
